## 📝 Transcript Explorer 

### Context

At Metaview, one of our core data assets is the transcription of conversations. A transcript is the textual representation of what was said between two or more people in a conversation. Amongst other things, they help the participants navigate the conversation (e.g. to remember something) after it's happened. As such, we need to have tools/products that enable our customers to navigate these transcripts.

### Product

**In this exercise, we want you to implement a [command-line application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) that enables an hypothetical customer to navigate the transcript of one of their conversations.**

We'll provide a bear bones repository, in your preferred language, that you can run, so that you can dive straight in without spending too much time on the initial setup. The input to this application will be a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) file representing the transcript and its associated metadata. To get you started, here are some of the outcomes, in order of importance, our customers may want to achieve this product:

1. As a conversation participant, I want to navigate through the transcript to read it, and remind myself what we all said throughout the conversation.
2. As someone who wasn't in the conversation, I want to be able to check specific parts of the conversation pointed out to me (e.g. "Hey, check out the last 10 minutes of that chat; Jen had some interesting questions.").

Also, we need this product to have the following characteristics:

1. **🤗 Frictionless:** The customer should swiftly be on the shortest path to their desired outcome.
2. **🧰 Utilitarian:** The product should be useful and practical, without unnecessary distractions.
3. **🦋 Beautiful:** Beauty is felt with the heart; we want the product's customers to share this sentiment.

### Expectations

The scope of your execution should be for the quickest shippable implementation of this product. This exercise is intentionally open-ended and you're not expected to "finish" it. We expect to spend no more than an hour on this exercise.

### Evaluation

We're using this exercise as a means to learn more about your:

- **🛠 Practical technical execution:** Ability to implement a solution based on the desired outcomes and characteristics.
- **💞 Customer empathy:** Ability to put yourself in the customers' shoes to consider how your execution might affect them.
- **🚀 Knack for making the right trade-offs:** Ability to know when it makes sense to take the scrappy vs. the scalable approach.
