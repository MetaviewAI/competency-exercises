## Audio Capture Bot

### Background

At Metaview, we give our customers their interview analytics no matter what the interview medium. Some interviews are in person, some are over video conference, and some are over the phone. As such, we need to have tools/products that enable us to capture the audio in any of these scenarios. Since we do our analysis on audio, we *don't* need these tools/products to capture the video.

### Product

**In this exercise, we want you to put on your Tech Lead hat and lead the discussion for the full stack implementation of a product that captures the audio in video conferences. If you prefer to collect your thoughts in written format, we'd encourage your output to be a design doc<sup>1</sup>. Alternatively, you can prepare your thoughts however you wish and share them with us over a conversation.**

We need this product to have the following characteristics:

1. **ü§ó Delightful:** The customer experience must be as delightful and as frictionless as possible.
2. **üèó Extensible:** Amongst our current customers, [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com) is the most common video conferencing tool. However, we'd need this product to be easily extended to support other types of providers (e.g. [Zoom](https://zoom.us/)) as and when required.
3. **üëÄ Observable:** When issues arise (e.g. the application crashes), we'd need to have enough information so that our debugging efforts are not entirely blind.

### Scope

The scope of your thinking should be for the quickest shippable implementation of this product. We appreciate this exercise is open-ended. We don't expect you to spend more than 6 hours on it.

### Evaluation

We're using this exercise as a means to learn more about your:

- **üêô Technical breadth:** Ability to design an end-to-end system satisfying the desired core characteristics.
- **üó£ Way with words:** Ability to communicate with customers, other technical teams, and non-technical partners to collect requirements and to describe software product features and technical designs.
- **üöÄ Knack for making the right trade-offs:** Ability to know when it makes sense to take the quick and dirty vs. the scalable approach.
