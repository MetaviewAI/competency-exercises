## 📝 Transcript Viewer 

### Context

At Metaview, one of our core data assets is conversation transcripts. A transcript contains the text of a conversation, along with metadata like timestamps, and who said what.

Amongst other things, transcripts help the participants navigate the conversation (e.g. to remember something) after it's happened. As such, we need to have tools/products that enable our customers to navigate these transcripts.

### Exercise

**In this exercise, we will provide a transcript in our internal JSON representation, and we want you to implement a program that displays this transcript in the console, in a way that can be read easily by a human.**

We'll provide a basic repository, in your preferred language, with boilerplate like file-loading already set up so you can dive straight in. The input to this application will be a JSON file representing the transcript and its associated metadata.

To get you started, here are some of the outcomes, in order of importance, our customers may want to achieve with this product:

1. As a conversation participant, I want to navigate through the transcript to read it, and remind myself what was said in the conversation.
2. As someone who wasn't in the conversation, I want to be able to check specific parts of the conversation (e.g. if someone said to me "Hey, check out the last 10 minutes of that chat; Jen had some interesting questions.").

We need this product to have the following characteristics:

1. **🤗 Frictionless:** The customer should swiftly be on the shortest path to their desired outcome.
2. **🧰  Utilitarian:** The product should be useful and practical, without unnecessary distractions.
3. **🦋 Beautiful:** Our customers should feel good about using the product.

### Expectations

We're aiming to **get something simple working** within the time allotted for the interview, however, this exercise is intentionally open-ended and it's up to you to decide on what can be done in the time available. We expect to spend less than an hour on this exercise.

### Evaluation

We're using this exercise as a means to learn more about your:

- **🛠 Practical technical execution:** We want to see your ability to implement a technical solution.
- **💞 Customer empathy:** We want to see how you think about customers when making product decisions.
- **🚀 Knack for making the right trade-offs:** We want to see how you navigate decisions like when to be scrappy instead of choosing a scalable solution.
